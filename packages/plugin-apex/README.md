## Introduction
This is an oclif plugin that supports the Salesforce Apex commands. The plugin is bundled with the [salesforcedx plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/salesforcedx).

Note: This plugin is in beta and has been released early so we can collect feedback. It may contain bugs, undergo major changes, or be discontinued.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in contributing, take a look at the [CONTRIBUTING](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

You can find more information about commands that the plugin provides in the [Commands](../../contributing/commands.md) doc.

```

### Linking the Plugin
